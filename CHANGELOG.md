## [1.3.1] - 2020-05-11
Updated ``tests`` submodule to 
[9687870](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/commit/b9f5fe33d4ebe8394f1f364bd824f1a0d8e9c345) 
(2020-04-27) `develop` branch state of the `ethereum/tests` library.

This is a pre-Berlin HF state (HF targeted for June/July 2020). Release is an intermediary
release for testing purposes to adopt to eventual test setup changes in `ethereum/tests`
on the usage side (`ethereumjs-vm`).

Behavioral changes can be tracked along Issue
https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-testing/issues/44 on this repo.

[1.3.1]: https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-testing/compare/v1.3.0...v1.3.1

## [1.3.0] - 2019-11-12
Updated ``tests`` submodule to [v7.0.0-beta.1](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/releases/tag/v7.0.0-beta.1) ``ethereum/tests`` release. This is the first release on
`ethereum/tests` with substantial **Istanbul support**.

Note that the release is coming with substantial format/location changes on the
tests repo (see "Test Format Changes" section within the release notes), e.g.
a new `LegacyTests` folder for tests on older HFs and a new subfolder structure
for the `BlockchainTests`. These changes will likely require some adoption on
integration.

and should be replaced with a tag-release based release once a new
tag-release becomes available on the `ethereum/tests` repo.
